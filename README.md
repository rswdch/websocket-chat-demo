This is a very basic demo of a websocket chatroom build with TypeScript and bundled using webpack.

```bash
npm install
# Run to build and serve front end
npm run serve
# Open a new terminal and run to start back end (on port 3001)
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to localhost:8080 to connect. Open another browser tab and see two clients connected at the same time.
